    ## 3.1 Converging nozzle

    # NOTE:
    # The NPRC value always lands approximately in the range [1.83 âˆ’ 1.89].
    # if npr < 1.83:
    #    no need to iterate to find sonic conditions, it will be a waste of time.
    #    The nozzle is adapted.
    # if 1.83 < npr < 1.89:
    #    Need to iterate on sonic condition, to find a more precise value of nprc.
    #    Then see if actually chocked or not.
    # if npr > 1.89:
    #    Nozzle is chocked for sure, but in that case we still need to iterate
    #    to find the sonic conditions.

    # Check nozzle pressure ratio.
    # print(f"{npr=:.4g}")
    # => 5.127
    # => Chocked for sure.

    # NOTE:
    # The computed NPR appears to be well over 1.9
    # => it can safely be assumed that the nozzle is chocked.
    # There was actually no need to get a more precise value of the NPRC through iterations.
    # This NPRC was computed mainly for curiosity, to see its values through iterations.
    # Anyways, the iterations are still necessary for a chocked nozzle,
    # because we have to compute the other sonic flow parameters at the chocked exhaust,
    # like the exhaust speed and pressure.

    # NOTE:
    # This only compute the quantities for a fictitious isentropic expansion
    # to the sonic speed (Ms_5 = 1), so that the nprc can be evaluated.
    # If the nozzle then appears to be chocked, these sonic quantities
    # then corresponds to the actual conditions at the nozzle exhaust.
